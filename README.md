## Contribution

You can fork the repository, improve or fix some part of it and then send the pull requests back if you want to see them here. I really appreciate that. :heart:

Remember to lint your code before sending pull requests. Run the Gulp lint task with the following command and fix the lint errors if you get any.

```bash
gulp lint
```
